# To-Do-List
A todo list to help keep track of tasks that need to be done or those that re alreday done. Use the clear btn to delete all previously saved items, the red button to permanently delete an item from the list, and the purple icon to cross off a task already done.
The enter key on the keboard or the add button can both be used to add an item to the list.
